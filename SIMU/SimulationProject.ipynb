    "# Molecular dynamic simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to implement a form of molecular dynamics simulation that is widely used in the study of colloidal systems, and is also a simple model of dense fluids. We will start with 4 disks, that are placed in a box and set-off with constant speed. The motion of the particles is controlled by the logic in the file [simul.py](simul.py). Which contains a simple `Class` to initialize the system and then to move forwards the particles. `__init__` sets the 4 particles in a standard position with the code `self.position=`. We then choose random velocities, and create sets of indexes `self._i`, `self._j` in order to be able to manage in interactions between pairs of particles. The graphical display of the result is perform by a second, independent `Class`: Is is created in the file [animatesimul.py](animatesimul.py). For the first day you should only need to modify the code in `simul.py`."

See [Pressure.ipynb](Pressure.ipynb) for more detail. Most of the logic can be treated using the function `np.where()`, see [Vectors.ipynb](Vectors.ipynb)"
