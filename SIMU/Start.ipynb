The two classes are written to cooperate, and are used together in [run.py](run.py). Note how the user of the [animatesimul.py](animatesimul.py) does not have to know anything about the window management. Everything is \"hidden\" in the class. The file [run.py](run.py) uses the two classes to run and animate a simulation. You should read [animatesimul.py](animatesimul.py) quickly to see what's there, but you will not have to understand it in detail for the first weeks. `animatesimul.py` will work with any class which defines TWO properties `position` and `md_step()`. You can rewrite the physics entirely in `simul.py` without modifying the display code."
